# PSEA
Implementation of PSEA - Pareto Search Evolutionary Algorithm.
An Interactive Multiobjective Optimization Evolutionary Algorithm driven by preferences represented using Achievement Scalarizing Funciton

The starting point for this work was NSGA-III algorithm capable of finding Pareto-Frontier for problems with up to 15 objective functions.
After implementing and testing NSGA-III preference elicitation was added to the algorithm.
